## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
    This project builds a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.
- What is the background of your project?
    A US-based company has BoomBikes provides a bike-sharing service that allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system. And user will only pay for the time he/she has used the bike
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
    BoomBikes has suffered a huge loss in revenue due to ongoing pandemic. So to accelearat their revenue they wants to understand which factors are affecting the demand of bikes the most. 
- What is the dataset that is being used.
    There is a 2 years of dataset which has weather information, workingday, holiday and weekday, temperature , season of the year and month of the year.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 - Months of the year doesn't impact the bike usage
- Conclusion 2 - Temperature or Temperature feeled by the users and working day directly affect the demand
- Conclusion 3 - Windspeed inversly affect the demand.
